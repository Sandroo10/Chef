        <li>12 smoked salmon slices</li>
        <li>1 package mini plain pappadums</li>
        <li>1 bunch watercress</li>
        <li>100 grams mascarpone cheese</li>

        <li>1 small purple onion</li>
    </ul>

        <h1>See the making below</h1>
        <p>Place 4 first course plates in the refrigerator.
            Pick the woody bits off the watercress and ensure you have 16 nice sprigs of water cress.
            Remove any brown blood lines off the slices of salmon.
            Place the mascarpone into a mixing bowl and zest 1 lime into it.
            Chop the capers and add to the mascarpone.
            Finely chop the onion and add about 1-2 tbsp to the mascarpone.
            Juice half of one of the limes into the mascarpone and the other half into another small mixing bowl.
            Whisk the mascarpone, add a couple tablespoons of olive oil and continue to mix until fully incorporated, season to taste with salt and pepper.
            Lightly brush either side of 15 pappadums with olive oil and laying one layer on a dinner plate microwave on high for approx 30-50 seconds (until crispy) turning once during cooking.
            
            Remove them from the microwave and allow to cool, continue process until all 15 are done.
            Add a touch of olive oil to the lime juice you set aside and whisk together, and toss the watercress through it (the watercress should not be dripping with the dressing, just a shadow of flavour).
            Squeeze the other lime into another bowl and again whisk in some olive oil, salt and pepper.</p>
